# PythonPongGame


# About
Here I created a Ping Pong game in Pythong. This is my first game I developed in python as well as the first python application that has a graphical user interface (GUI). This was a great way for me to segue into developing applications in pythin that posses a graphical user interface. This was also the third application I have developed in python with my first two application strictly being command line interface (CLI) applications.
